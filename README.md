#HeartBeatAnalysis Dashboard

*HeartBeatAnalysis Dashboard* shows the results on walking trip. 

The data was recored using a Motorola Moto G Android phone with the SenseView application ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=si.mobili.senseview ) installed and connected to a Polar H7 belt ( http://www.polar.com/us-en/products/accessories/H7_heart_rate_sensor ) in order to record the heart rate data. Information from the GPS and acceletarion sensor are also saved and exported at the end of the trip. 

This dashboard offer a view on all data recorded during a single trip. 
The complete code is available on my github repository at https://github.com/valerio-vaccaro/HeartBeatAnalysis. 

HeartBeatAnalysis Dashboard is based on *My Activity Dashboard*, a project developed for the Coursera course called Developing Data Products in order to show how data can be managed and presented using Shiny.
